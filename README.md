## Overview

"**Heat Acclimatization**" is known as an effective countermeasure against heatstroke. However, according to a survey by the Japanese Red Cross Society, only 12% of people in Japan fully understand its meaning , indicating that its importance and proper implementation methods are not widely known.

**Acc-Temp** was developed to solve this issue. It is a support system that accurately manages the acclimatization status of each worker based on data, facilitating the introduction of planned and safe heatstroke countermeasures.

## Key Features

This system implements the following features to support the execution and management of heat acclimatization:

-   **1. Acclimatization Plan Management**
    -   Operates the heat acclimatization management system, intended to be used with an attendance and labor system.
    -   At the start of a work shift, it automatically notifies each individual of their recommended work time based on their personal acclimatization progress.

-   **2. Work Restriction Settings**
    -   Calculates a recommended safe work time based on an individual's heat acclimatization progress.
    -   It applies the "20% Rule" recommended by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

-   **3. Record of Implemented Countermeasures**
    -   Records that the company is properly implementing heatstroke countermeasures, which supports proof of its safety management system.

## Background

-   **Cause of Heatstroke**: It occurs when the body accumulates heat due to an imbalance of water and salt, or a breakdown of its thermoregulation functions.
-   **Effective Countermeasure**: "Heat Acclimatization," the process of gradually getting the body used to the heat, is an effective countermeasure that can reduce the risk of heatstroke.
-   **Current Situation in Japan**: Awareness of heat acclimatization is low in Japan, with only 12% of people fully understanding its meaning. Based on this situation, this system aims to support the execution and management of heat acclimatization.
